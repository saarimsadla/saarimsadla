## About Me

I’m an AWS Certified Solutions Architect with over eight years of hands on experience building and modernizing enterprise platforms. Most of my work sits at the intersection of cloud architecture, DevOps, data engineering, and applied machine learning. I care a lot about systems that scale cleanly, stay secure, and don’t waste money for no reason.

Outside of industry work, I teach as an Adjunct Professor at Durham and Conestoga Colleges. That role keeps me grounded. Explaining cloud and data concepts to students forces clarity, and honestly it sharpens how I think about real world systems too.

## Cloud, DevOps, and Platform Engineering

What I spend most of my time on:

Cloud migrations and modernization work, especially moving monoliths toward event driven and serverless designs  
Infrastructure as Code using Terraform and CloudFormation so environments are repeatable and boring in the best way  
Cost optimization and FinOps, because great architecture that’s too expensive still fails  
CI and CD automation with security baked into the pipeline, not bolted on later  
High availability and multi region designs that assume things will break eventually

I’ve spent years designing backend systems and APIs, mostly REST based and event driven. A lot of that work involves data pipelines, sometimes batch heavy, sometimes closer to streaming, depending on the business problem.

On the data side, I’ve worked extensively with Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB, and Cassandra. I’m comfortable designing schemas, tuning queries, and fixing things when they slow down under real load. Microservices and containerized workloads are part of the day to day, not buzzwords on a slide.

## Data Engineering and Machine Learning

Some of my more interesting work has been in applied ML. Not research for the sake of it, but models that actually ship.

That includes TensorFlow based models, GIS and geospatial ML using satellite imagery, and data validation pipelines that clean and enrich messy real world datasets. I’ve also built analytics platforms that support operational decision making, where accuracy matters but usability matters just as much.

## Professional Experience Highlights

### Team Lead and Senior Software Engineer, Franklin Energy (2023 to Present)

I lead cross functional POD teams delivering large scale energy analytics platforms. A big win here was migrating EC2 heavy systems toward event driven AWS architectures using Lambda, SQS, and EventBridge. That shift alone cut costs by about forty percent and reduced processing times by half.

I also architected ETL pipelines across Python, Go, and PHP, built ML powered GIS models using TensorFlow, and implemented multi region MongoDB replica sets with zero downtime failover. When things break at scale, that last part really matters.

### Lead Software Engineer, Nishat Mills Ltd. (2019 to 2023)

This role was deep in enterprise systems. I helped deliver platforms across seven manufacturing facilities and designed cloud ready ERP, HR, payroll, and procurement systems serving over ten thousand users.

Automation was a constant theme. By removing manual workflows and tightening integrations, we reduced operational overhead by roughly forty percent.

### Senior Technical Consultant, PwC Network (2019)

Here the focus was governance and correctness. I built SOX compliant, audit ready systems and optimized Oracle PL and SQL pipelines to reduce memory usage while improving performance. Not flashy work, but critical work.

## Academic and Mentorship Work

Adjunct Professor at Durham and Conestoga Colleges (2024 to Present)

I teach Cloud Fundamentals, Data Engineering, Web Development, and emerging trends in Big Data. Mentoring capstone projects is the most rewarding part. Watching students connect theory to real systems never gets old.
